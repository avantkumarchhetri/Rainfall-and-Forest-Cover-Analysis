# Rainfall-and-Forest-Cover-Analysis

**Summary**

We all know ho important plants and trees are for the survival of human beings on this planet. One of the most important
things that trees and plants require to survive is water. They get this water by the many forms of precipitation i.e. rainfall,
glaciers melting and even snow. The main purpose of this project is to show a positive relationship between the forest cover of an area
and the amount of rainfall the area receives.

This is a mini project created using R and Microsoft Power BI.
This project is about the concepts learned in R programming. 
It mainly focus on ggplot() function and analyzing and visualizing the data 
on Forest Cover of the states of India and itâ€™s relation with the amount of annual 
rainfall it receives. 
This project uses various visualization tools such as scatter 
plot, regression lines etc. to draw inferences.
In this project a sample .csv file named as rainfall.csv is used and 
imported into RStudio, then some predefined functions are applied.

The dataset has been custom made after collecting different features from various websites like The Forest Survey of 
India Report and mydata.gov.in .

Here are some visualizations of the dataset.

Plotting a scatterplot before and after inserting tthe line of best fit

See how most of the points lie on or near the line of best fit. This shows a positive correlation.
Well, there are some outliers, but, they all have different geological reasons like location, extent 
and other climatic factors.
